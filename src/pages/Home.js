                            <br />

                            From dope crewneck sweaters to fresh dad hats, bomber jackets with patches and embroidered t-shirts. These are just some of the items we want to get out there. Some will showcase recognisable Fang Gang imagery and brands from their world, like Wildfangz and BITE.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            And other items will have completely new and unique designs so everyone can rock the sickest fits.
