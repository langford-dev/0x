                    To know Carrotism is to know pain‚Ä¶a fire, scorching every fleck of your furry outer coat.
                    In the beginning  there was nothing‚Ä¶a void‚Ä¶carrotless as far as the eyes could see and the ears could hear.
                    The Elder Buni‚Äôs floated, drifting furlessly in the midst of a nebulous medium.
                    The carrots changed everything. They brought a new pallet of feelings both physical and mental. They brought harmony, joy, love  and laughter.

                    Anhysby and his band of Fearless warriors had nothing to strive for, lacking an epicentre of hope.
                    The carrots filled the trench, the carrots were more than a delicious crunchy vegetable. They were the missing piece to a joke in which the Elder buni‚Äôs were unaware needed filling.
                    They harnessed this power‚Ä¶they evolved‚Ä¶they bread‚Ä¶..like Buni‚Äôs.
